# RGB-Channels-Speration-Toddler-Project
This study is a practical study and this part will only guide children about how computers see the world.
## Requirement


For the application, you can first get an image that your child will like, then you can take 3 prints that can be seen with red, blue and green plexiglass and try it in a practical way.

In the future, I will add saving with transparent PNG to the code part.

Have fun
